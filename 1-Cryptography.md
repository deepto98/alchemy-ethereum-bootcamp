   *  Deterministic - One specific input always maps to the same specific output
   *  Pseudorandom - It is not possible to guess the output based on the output of similar inputs
   *  One-way - If someone gives you a new output, you could not determine an input without guessing
   *  Fast to Compute - It must be a quick calculation for a computer
   *  Collision-resistant - The chance of a collision should be infinitesimally small
